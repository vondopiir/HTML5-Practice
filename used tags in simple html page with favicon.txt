I have used the following html tags for creating this page:

<h1></h1>
<h2><.h2>
<h3></h3>
<b></b
<i></i>
<mark></mark>
<center></center>
<ol></ol>
<ul></ul>
<a>
<img>
<link>

Some cool features of this page:
	* this page is fully responsive
	* this page has favicon
	* this page has so many useful links
	* used only html
